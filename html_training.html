			<h1>This is my laptop test website</h1>
			<h3>Description:</h3>
			<p>I will be using this as a way to show everything ive learned in html and css.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="declarations">
			<h3>Types of declaration</h3>
			<!-- types of text declarations -->
			<p><strong>Beware</strong>: There be <em>epherial dragons</em> in these parts</p>
			<br /> <!-- This is a line break -->
			<hr /> <!-- This is a horizontal rule or line divider-->
			<p>This is <b>BOLD</b>, This is <i>italic</i></p>
			<br />
			<hr /> <!-- <b> is not as important as <strong>, same with <i> vs <em> -->
			<p>Numbers have suffixes such as three squared or 3<sup>2</sup> and subscripts such as carbon dioxide or CO<sub>2</sub></p>

			<h3>Quotations and Citations</h3>
			<p>Below is an example from the HTML and CSS book by Jon 
			Duckett on block quotations.</p>
			<!--Blcok quotes require a citation tag-->
			<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh">Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</blockquote>
			<br />
			<hr />
			<p><q>A standard version of a quotation is this<q>. Internet explorer doesnt use this q tag properly so block quote is preffered for making quotes.</p>
			<!-- standard quote tag is <q>-->
			<br />
			<hr />
			<!-- abbreviations pop ups require a title tag within the abbr tag-->
			<p><abbr title="Doctor">Doc</abbr> Brohemious Tony studied at the <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>. Abbreviations should only be used for excessively long titles or accronyms</p>
			

			<br />
			<hr />
			<p><cite>A brief history in time</cite> is a book by Stephen Hawking, the guy famous for being on <em>Epsteins Island</em></p>
			<p>As seen in this Paragraph, cite and em act in a similar way, however cite is a more powerful version of em that has a more semantic use.</p>
			<p>Stephen Hawking used be famous for his studies on <dfn>Black Holes</dfn> and <dfn>Dark Matter</dfn>. These are technical terms covered by the dfn tag only the first time they appear. <abbr title="defining instance">DFN</abbr> stands for defining instance</p>

			<br />
			<hr />
			<p>Address tag is used to list the details of a page author. Below is an example</p>
			<address>
				<p><a href="mailto:homer@example.org">homer@example.org</a></p>
				<p>742 Evergreen Terrace. Springfield.</p>
			</address>
			<!-- address tags will display content in hyperlinks-->
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Content Changes</h3>
			<p>ins, del, and s</p>
			<p> if I want to delete and insert a word into a paragraph, i can use the del tag around the word im removing and the ins tag with a new word between the open and close ins tag to insert a new word.
			<p>This has got do be the <del>worst</del> <ins>GREATEST AND TOTALLY NOT WORST</ins> tag ever made</p>
			<!-- del will cross out the old word on the page-->
			<!-- ins will underline new content inserted-->

			<br />
			<hr />
			<p>s tag indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevent but shouldnt be deleted. <s>crosses out content without the need to insert after it</s></p>
