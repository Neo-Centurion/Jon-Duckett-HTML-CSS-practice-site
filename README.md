# Jon-Duckett-HTML-CSS-practice-site
This is a site ill be regularly updating through github that follows my journey through self training in html and css to further my education. The examples in this site are my own versions of the examples in the book "HTML &amp; CSS" By Jon Duckett without violation of copyright. This will help me understand Github and the two languages in my own way
